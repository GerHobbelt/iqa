2011-04-09  1.1.0

 - Added MS-SSIM algorithm.
 - Added MS-SSIM* algorithm.
 - Fixed bug (#3269715) that caused SSIM to return inflated results when using
   custom SSIM arguments.
 - Fixed bug (#3269702) where the SSIM algorithm was returning NAN instead of
   INFINITY on error. Since NAN always fails comparisons (even with itself),
   there was no way for an application to determine if an error occurred.
 - Improved the performace of the decimate operation.

2011-04-01  1.0.0
